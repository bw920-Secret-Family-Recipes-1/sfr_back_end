Anyone can go out and buy a cookbook these days, but I want a place to store all my secret family recipes, handed down from generation to generation.

The little cards my grandma wrote the recipes on in her beautiful cursive are getting lost or are hard to read. I need somewhere secure to keep my recipes with me at all times!

Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?
The time deterioration of paper card recipes. 
	Long term storage and privacy of family recipes 
	
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
	We allow our customers to save an image and the recipe information to our database for long term storage and safety. With easy accessibility for the clients to use the recipes on a convenient platform. 

- What is the mission statement?
	We will come back to it
Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
	CRUD, Search by categories or title, onboarding process, ability to enter a new recipe, home page to view recipes. 
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
Image adding, permissions, conversion to cook by weight rather than cups
- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
	Pinterest - allows ppl to find recipes
	Ecrimes - saves data long term but grandmas pie isnt included
	We are at the cutting edge of the market and have no competitors 
Frameworks - Libraries

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
	Will be managed with a token
- Are you required to pay to use the API?
	no
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
no
For Data Scientists


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
People who eat
People with recipes
Families 
Humans
Foodies
Those with secrets to guard 
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
Its a good idea, Lives will be shaped for the better. 
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?


Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
